      <description>By the end of this tutorial you will know how to create a windowed application in the Eclipse Engine.
Due to the nature of the Eclipse Engine being modular, applications do not have a window by default and you must add it as an engine module. In this tutorial we will go through on how to do just that and go through how to customize the window to your liking.</description>

      <description>The Eclipse Engine has been designed to be as modular as possible, due to this design decision there is quite a bit of setup, but don&amp;rsquo;t worry. I promise its simple!.
The first thing you want to do is actually acquire the engine and compile it for your development platform (windows &amp;amp; linux) the Eclipse Engine uses GitHub to house all its source code (as it follows the open source standard).</description>
